# Battleship
In this project I built a browser battleship game using ReactJS. The project is based on The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship). While the initial aim of the project was to employ TDD (Test Driven Development), I decided to use the project to also practice developing with the React framework.

## My objectives
- Practice TDD (Test Driven Development) using Jest.
- Use functional components instead of class components in React.
- Utilize React hooks.
- Practice CSS in JS using styled components.
- Implement a "smart" AI opponent that does more than just attack random spots on the board.
- Apply principles of responsive design.
